## üîß Configuration

### System Configuration (`config.json`)
```json
{
  "yolo": {
    "model": "yolov8s.pt",
    "confidence_threshold": 0.4,
    "iou_threshold": 0.5
  },
  "analysis": {
    "interval_seconds": 5,
    "max_iterations": 20,
    "min_green_time": 5.0,
    "max_green_time": 60.0
  }
}
```

### Vehicle Weights
The system uses weighted scoring for different vehicle types:
- **Cars**: 1.0x (baseline)
- **Trucks**: 2.0x (need more time)
- **Buses**: 2.5x (highest priority)
- **Motorcycles**: 0.5x (faster movement)
- **Bicycles**: 0.3x (minimal impact)

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### Speed Improvements
- **Model Selection**: Use `yolov8n.pt` for faster processing
- **Frame Sampling**: Adjust analysis interval for real-time performance
- **Threading**: Background processing doesn't block the UI
- **Caching**: Results cached to prevent duplicate processing

### Accuracy Improvements
- **Model Selection**: Use `yolov8x.pt` for better detection accuracy
- **Confidence Tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on video quality
- **Multiple Classes**: Detects various vehicle types for better planning

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Videos not uploading**
- Check file format (must be MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, or WMV)
- Verify file size is under 100MB
- Ensure stable internet connection

**Detection not working**
- Verify YOLO model downloaded correctly
- Check video quality and lighting
- Adjust confidence threshold in settings

**Analysis stops unexpectedly**
- Check system logs in `traffic_system.log`
- Verify sufficient memory available
- Restart the application if needed

**Poor signal timing results**
- Upload higher quality videos
- Increase confidence threshold
- Ensure videos show actual traffic scenes

### Performance Issues
- **High CPU usage**: Use smaller YOLO model (yolov8n.pt)
- **Memory issues**: Reduce max iterations or video resolution
- **Slow processing**: Increase analysis interval between frames

## üîí Security Considerations

- File upload validation prevents malicious files
- Secure filename handling prevents directory traversal
- Input validation on all API endpoints
- No external network access required for core functionality
